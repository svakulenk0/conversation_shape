"Edited to add: results were ""found no integrity issues"".",F
Found the sticky notes data hiding in C:\Users\(my first name)\Roaming\AppData and got a message asking if I wanted to look for an app in the AppStore.,R
Why are we being given references on how to do a clean boot with every OS but windows 10 ?,R
How will an sfc scan or a clean boot help to recover the missing data !,R
"I have found the files, but what am I supposed to use to open them?",R
"There are several different apps of the same name in the Microsoft store and I can't tell which, if any, is the correct one.",F
Sticky Notes can be found under Windows Accessories under All Apps in the Start Menu.,F
Yes!,F
This was the answer!,F
Thank you!,F
Thanks!,F
I checked there initially and it was nowhere to be found.,F
I suspect it was restored in an update.,F
All is well that ends well.,F
stickynotes can't be found there and Microsoft even erased  C:\Users\your user name\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Sticky Notes  Where they used to be.,F
I had info I need on them.,R
Horrible for Microsoft to do this to us.,F
You are wrong,F
"All the answers are before 6-10-16, when Microsoft removed sticky notes, are wrong.",F
Microsoft also removed  C:\Users\UserName\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Sticky where the used to be.,F
Accept it your Microsoft sticky notes are gone.,R
The apps that Microsoft recommends in the Microsoft store are clumsy.,F
"there is an app ""stickies"" that is similar, but better and backs up notes.",F

I still have Sticky Notes on my system and I am up-to-date with all Windows 10 updates.,F
Nope.,F
"But I did get an error message about the file not being where it used to be, as if I had changed the filename, which I have not.",F
I've been searching for some time for my Sticky Notes.,R
"All that was left after updating Windows was the shortcut, which didn't work in the Start Menu.",F

Microsoft updated my Windows 10.,F
Now all my Sticky Notes have disappeared.,F
I had multiple ones on my screen which had a bunch of important bits of information.,F
Clicking on Sticky Notes I can bring up and write a new one but I need to bring up all the old ones.,F
How do I do this?,R
I'm 78 without many computer skills.,F
Solutions listed in search do not seem to apply to my situtation,F
I lost my sticky notes (my whole life was on there) when Windows 10 automatically updated to the Anniversary edition.,F
"When I originally upgraded to windows 10, the sticky notes were there.",F
Microsoft wants to charge me to even talk to me.,F
I got no warning about an update to the Anniversary edition.,F
"If I download sticky notes from APPS, do I get my original sticky notes back?",R
And all I could find in the app store looked like it was sticky notes for Windows 8.,F
"HELP Joshua, I'm sorry this happened to you!",F
"I've never used this forum, so I don't know if what I wrote as a Reply will be seen by Microsoft.",F
"It was intended for them, not as a solution for you.....sorry.",F
Did you ever get it fixed?,R
"There will be a new app on your computer called, Windows Ink.",F
Open that up.,R
You should see Sticky Notes at the top.,F
"Click on Sticky Notes, and that should open them up for you.",R
"Hi, my pc did a massive update this morning and I have had the same problem - all sticky notes seem to have vanished.",F
"I was trying to get them back and not succeeding and getting very angry with Microsoft when I discovered that if you delete the single sticky note that is visible on the desktop (click on sticky notes in the bottom task bar to bring it up) and say yes I want to delete, when it goes, the next one comes up - and if you delete that, the one after comes up, and so on -  my sticky notes are all there!!!",F
Phew.,F
"So I opened a new word doc, saved it to documents, and copied or cut all the precious important text from each note then deleted it and carried on until all sticky notes were deleted but nor before I had saved all the info in the aforesaid word doc.",F
I am sure I will use sticky notes again but from now on will ensure I also save the vital info on them in a word doc somewhere!,F
I hope this helps folks.,F
"PS to Microsoft - SHAME ON YOU, Grrr!",F
"Hi Morgan, I just found all my sticky notes, by accident.",G
"If you can still see one of your previous notes, copy the text to somewhere safe then delete the note, the next one of your sticky notes should then appear.",F
They seem to be hiding behind each other and become visible when you delete the one 'in front'.,F
Hopes this works for you.,R
And I totally agree with your comments to Microsoft...,F
"Hi Kyle, Thank you for the info, but I don't even have the sticky note icon in the task bar anymore, and not one sticky note on the desktop.",F
"When I click on Task Manager to see what's running, Sticky Notes are now gone from that menu.",F
Did your last update give you what they call Windows Anniversary edition?,R
That was my last automatic update and is when the sticky notes disappeared.,F
"When I first upgraded to the original Windows 10, they were still there.",F
?????,R
"MICROSOFT, I WANT MY STICKY NOTES BACK!",F
"Hi, I had the same problem.",F
Frustration plus!!,F
I clicked on the task bar itself.,F
The window that came up was a black window.,F
"I saw that ""Show Window's Ink Space Button"" was not checked.",F
I checked that.,F
"The icon appeared on the task bar on the bottom, on the lower right side.",F
I clicked on this new task bar icon.,F
A new window appeared and at the top was sticky note.,F
Click on the sticky notes window.,R
All of your sticky notes appear--and also a ton of ones that you had thought you deleted a long time ago--you have to go one by one and delete these again.,F
The only thing I haven't figured out yet is how to re-size the sticky note.,F
They are quite large.,F
Hope this helps others--I know how frustrating this is.,F
"They are now back on my desktop when I sign in, and the icon for sticky notes is in the task bar where it used to be.",F
"yes, that was a better, more thorough description of what I had suggested earlier - sorry I wasn't more descriptive (I think I must have lost patience with the whole thing).",F
OH THANK YOU SO MUCH I FOUND AGAIN ALL MY NOTES TXTXTXTXTXTXTXTX,F
"Hi, Ian!",G
We had the same problem.,F
"After searching the Internet (which was not helpful) and looking around on the computer, we had an accidental bit of luck.",F
"If you type ""Sticky Notes"" into Cortana where it says ""Ask Me Anything"" on the left in the bottom task bar, ""Sticky Notes"" should show up as the ""Best Match.""",F
"Click that, and all of your sticky notes should appear on your desktop.",R
They will all be behind each other.,F
"So, click on the first and drag it until you reveal all of your notes.",R
"And, just to be safe, save them in a word document, because who knows when Microsoft will choose to be ""helpful"" again.",F
;) Hope this helps!,R
!,F
"My ""Sticky Note"" is running in SLOW MOTION (types one letter about every 3 seconds).",F
How can I fix this huge problem?,R
I use sticky notes everyday...or I used to.,F
Now I can't use it because it's so slow that I can't use it.,F
Thank you Joshua... it worked.,F
Sam,F
It is not in my accessories.,F
I did get my sticky notes back and took off the information.,F
That was good but they don't work the same.,F
I used to be able to copy and paste from a word doc and now I am unable to do that.,F
I guess just like the NEW Outlook.,F
It is crap.,F
That has disappeared too.,F
Guess what?,R
I can't find it in Windows Accessories either!,F
!,F
Not on my 15063 Build,F
You're kidding me.,F
Sticky notes disappeared and only 2 tiles remain in the start menu.,F
Windows 10 Home.,F
On my computer W10 Home sticky notes simply disappeared.,F
The original sticky notes is not in Windows Accessories.,F
I had valuable information on those notes.,R
Now they're lost.,F
I wish MS would quit tinkering with Windows 10.,F
I can't be sure from one day to the next if I can continue doing my work.,F

"I would like to build an Automator application that counts the files in the hostfolder, creates a numbered subfolder named "" [hostFolder name] [counter] "", moves at maximum 128 files from hostFolder in sequential order into this new subfolder, and loops until all files in hostFolder are sorted into subfolders (i.e.",F

Thanks.,F
"Whatever you do, leave the faulty disk alone until you know what you are going to do.",F
The risk that the disk breaks entirely any moment now is very high.,F

The advantage is that there is no stress on the faulty disk.Method A – If you want to save individual files:Go to the menu bar and select Terminal.Copy the files you want to rescue using <code>cp</code>.,R
"For instance, if you have a folder <code>rescueme</code> on your desktop, you can use the following command: <code>cp -r /Volumes/mydisk/Users/myusername/Desktop/rescueme /Volumes/mybackupdisk/</code>This will copy all files and subfolders of <code>rescueme</code> onto your backup drive called <code>mybackupdisk</code>.Method B – If you want to make a full backup:Enter the Disk Utility toolSelect the Disk that you want to back upIn the menu bar select <code>File &gt; New Image &gt; Image from “mydisk”</code>Select your options.",F
E.g.,F
you may want to compress the image to save some space on the backup disk.Press <code>Save</code> and wait.It is likely that some parts of your disk are not readable anymore.,R
Therefore the method B may not work and you should first try to save the most important files manually (i.e.,F
"method A).Method C - if you have another Mac:Connect the two computers, e.g.",F
"with a Thunderbolt cable.On your broken iMac, press T at the boot screen to enter <a href=""https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201462"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">target disk mode.Now you can use the Finder to browse the broken disk and copy files.",F
Thank you so much for these suggestions.,F

"Without knowing your exact model of Mac and version of macOS, I have a different way for you to achieve the exact same thing without having to create an Automator service and setting a keyboard shortcut.Follow these steps:Go to Apple > System PreferencesClick on Security &amp; PrivacySelect the General tabTick the checkbox for requiring a password after sleep or screensaver begins (if you can't tick it, unlock the Padlock at bottom left of the window).",R
"Note: You may need to enter a password to make the change.Now from the associated drop-down, select ImmediatelyExit System PreferencesNow you can lock the screen with one of two built-in macOS keyboard shortcuts (depending on your Mac model):Control+Shift+EjectControl+Shift+Power ButtonThe above macOS shortcuts will put your display to sleep, and because of the change in your Security &amp; Privacy preferences, this will activate the password prompt upon waking it up.Touch Bar modelsIf you have a 2016 MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, the above keyboard shortcuts aren't available.",F

Thank you.,F
Outside of the lock icon when using a non-mac keyboard I still like the lock shortcut it would just be nice if it worked when the finder menu bar was visible.,F
I have put the lock button into the top menu bar tray and I use that when I don't want to loose my vpn access.,F
For some reason the lockscreen method above when locking the screen causes my vpn to disconnect though other tasks that run in the background appear to be fine.,F
"If you're connecting to your VPN via Wi-Fi, you may want to read the various answers to this [question](https://apple.stackexchange.com/q/71884/168832) as they offer many solutions to a Wi-Fi disconnection during screen lock.",F
Wired connection.,F
I tested it again and same thing I used the crtl-shift-f15 and it shows my screensaver and the cisco vpn drops the connection.,F
Clicking the lock icon in the tray of the ios menu bar works and does not drop the vpn connection.,F
Any more thoughts on why the keyboard shortcut wouldn't work with the finder being the active program?,R
"Not really, but I do have a suggestion re your dropped vpn connection.",F
Namely you would create a new location and then ensure that your wired (I assume ethernet) connection is at the top of your Service Order.,F
Go to System Preferences > Network.,R
At the top use the Location drop-down to select _Edit Location_.,F
Click on the plus button to add a new location (e.g.,R
Home).,F
Click Done.,R
"Now, on your main window, ensure you have the new location selected......Now, click on the cog icon and select _Set Service Order..._ In the list that appears, ensure your vpn connection is at the top (just click and drag).",R
Make sure other items are also in the order you want.,R
Click OK.,R
"While you're at it, on the main Network preference window you may want to totally remove any services you know you won't use (select and click the minus button).",F

"I'm a mid-level user, I only know how to use Automator, where it can't be done.Failing an automatic solution, I could use a random string generator and change filenames manually.",F

"Long story short, I noticed a dramatic slowdown in Windows (in Bootcamp) and on the Mac.",F
"After installing DriveDx, it reported that I had around 8,600 Reported Uncorrectable Errors.",F
"To my knowledge, that essentially means bad blocks/sectors.",F
"After looking at <a href=""https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/81093/what-are-next-steps-when-fsck-reports-could-not-be-repaired-after-3-attempts"">this post, I followed the <code>fsck_hfs</code> commands.",F
I actually checked for bad blocks first using the <code>/sbin/fsck_hfs -S /dev/disk0s2</code> and then ran the <code>/sbin/fsck_hfs -drfy /dev/disk0s2</code> command.,F
"After running the check Debug, Repair, Force command five times, all it would return is ""The volume was modified"" which to my research says that it is not complete, and that you should run it again.A couple of questions.",F

hello,G
I was trying to get a hold of this book,F
software,F
sorry,F
I think its both,F
Software would mean it would be used on the computer...,F
is that what you are looking for?,R
Yes,F
Ok.,F
"The isbn you gave me is an audio cd, not software.",F
ISBN-13 : 9780743506595,F

I see these two ISBN's,F
"Yes, that's an audio CD, not software.",F
It is supposed to teach reading,F
so I am assuming there must be a book as well,F
?,R
It doesn't teach reading...,F
It is a language program that teaches speaking and understanding the language.,F
through an audio cd,F
Are you still interested in finding it?,R
9780743544900,F
how about this one?,R
because from there site this should be both,F
It's still primarily an audio CD.,F
"It may have a small lesson book to go along with it, but it is not computer software.",F

Why do these have two ISBN's,R
what is the difference between ISBN 10 or 13?,R

though one maybe referenced multimedia and the other books,F
Your library does not have these items.,R

you mean the whole of the houston library system doesnt carry them?,R

"The catalog searches the whole system, not just one branch.",F
Ok,F
so when using ILL that will borrow from a neighboring county library system or something similar?,R
"Yes, that's correct.",F
Is it only Pimsleur you want?,R
The library has other Arabic courses.,F
Because I dont only need to go to Alief,F
I mean I can go another branch,F
but if Houston Library doesnt have them,F
then thats different,F

Correct,F
But that is different then the ISBN's I gave you before,F
?,R
"Yes, that's why I asked if you wanted something different.",F
That would still teach you the language.,F
Yes that would work,F
Ok.,F
do they incude written though,R
learning to read and write,F
"Just like the ones you originally saw, they include a small, supplemental book.",F

so imagine that you recently began suffering from migraines month sucks if you heard about two possible treatments for migraine headaches beta blockers and or calcium channel blockers and you decided to do some research about that,F
at the same time you want to explore whether there are options for treating migraines without taking medicines such as diet and exercise,F
all right so yeah we got a list of things here,F
uh we got beta blockers,F
so i would,F
i'd suggest either like webmd or the mail client the male clinic has a lot of stuff online,F
yeah i agree,F
and so then we could just look for michael,F
headaches and they got all those sections in there i think and then we can see what we got,F
thanks,F
right let's see here,R
going in the official site,F
and i can either search,F
or,F
drilldown easier let's see i think i'll just type in my career,R
migraine treatment will go there,F
see if any of those,R
anti depressants,F
nerve stimulation,F
depends on diagnosis,F
overview,F
my goodness sometime,F
yeah it's gonna be overview one,F
so this is basically just some definition of what a migraine is an,F
doesn't happen in your links on the page or anything like that,F
yeah that's what i'm looking at now there's a link that i'm going to go through a couple of moments as a migraine care at mayo clinic,F
symptoms and causes,R
and then related we have a ton of,F
stuff here alleviating the pain medications antidepressants,F
i'm just going to you know what real quick,F
i'm a fan of the,F
so the word locker,F
isn't on this page anywhere,R
just doing a search for the pay on the page to see if,R
hello,G
so i might look these up independently,F
on the male side just to see,F
because it is but did it,F
i think,F
typically ask for information about beta blockers,R
yes and ask for beta blockers calcium channel blockers for the treatment of migraine headaches and then,R
okay,F
time to explore other options that reminds,F
ticking menace this,F
i think we're going to have to get to best ear university for that one,F
the whole,F
no hopefully we can avoid that i mean there may be is maybe some lifestyle lies like you know never get out of your bed ever again or something so,F
holistic,F
yeah so i did type in beta blockers in um,F
he there's three hundred ninety five links for beta blockers us so,F
um,F
i can see if it's used for the treatment,F
of,F
mason to search for migraine,F
interesting,F
nothing on the,F
at least on the first page there's nothing,F
are related to bethe the word beta,R
in beta blockers and migraine,F
okay,F
oh so let's do it let's back out of this then because it sounds like we're getting too deep because the systems too complex i let's just do a general internet search for beta blockers and,R
there,F
okay,F
better blockers and migraine maybe we'll get get a hit on that and then we could go back and do they calcium channel blockers and migraine and then diet exercise and my,F
brain and see if we get anything cause,R
i'm not sure if i want to ask if you prefer speak just at,F
yeah,F
i mean this is the this this this is our head we're talking about right i mean,F
yeah,F
yeah so it looks like my green dot com are beta blockers shoes for migraines,F
this is beta blockers are commonly used for treating,F
high blood pressure and other heart issues are also prescribe to prevent migraines beta blockers are also sometimes called beta,F
in genetic blocking age,F
it's,F
studies show that beta blockers reduce migraine frequency and fifty percent of studied patience,F
okay that's not bad sources bash,F
on this comes from,F
my green dot com,F
so sounds official,F
the sights a little,F
thanks little cheesy,F
no a a little bit i'm trying to see,F
i'm going to try to look at the bottom and see who um,F
health union,F
llc,F
looks like the publisher,F
okay,F
so i don't know who health union is but,F
what other did you get any other hits them back on that search,R
yeah that was actually beings um answer,F
okay,F
my green dot com webmd has something,F
yeah it's not whether the i i trust with andy,F
all right,F
so when i really want to know is it out,F
if i take this drug and i reduce my reduced by a reduced by grace by like fifty percent and then i'd grown other hand i prefer not have another hand groping outside,F
yeah,F
okay so we have um webmd actually gives names for some of the,F
beta blockers,F
leprae sorrel opie are dss so are,F
top role teos piaroa well,F
and a couple other names and their generic names in it it talks about how it works basically looks at the same stuff,F
not yeah,F
okay,F
so what kind of side effects are we looking at for this,R
so,F
effects well all medicines have side effects but many people don't feel like the side effects don't feel the side effects or they're able to deal with them,F
a sequence of the chase here,F
uh usually benefit from the medicine are more important than any other minor side effect so they're saying these side effects aren't as are worth the while,F
i'll see if i can get them called out here,F
uh okay so this is call your doctor if so i guess these are symptoms possibly,F
okay,F
call your doctor if you have hives slow heart rate less than fifty beats per minute swelling in your legs or feet shortness of breath or whizzing especially if you have asthma cold hands and feet oh common side effects here we go,R
okay okay okay,F
dizziness or lightheadedness,F
feeling tired,F
trouble sleeping,F
senate,F
says see drug reference for a full list of side effects drug reference is not available in all systems,F
oh is there are,R
well let's not look let's not look there that can cause we only got ten minutes ago to this query and uh i have i am satisfied that i might not want to be dizzy tired can't sleep on the topic,R
okay,F
all right,F
so then we said water calcium,F
can calcium channel blockers and migraine,F
sounds made up,F
we have a web india again and the male clinic actually,F
okay,F
oh they actually decide to get a something useful this time,F
well it says it has channel blocker,F
listed on the male clinic but it doesn't have anything,F
fuck shit,F
necessarily about migraines but i'll check on health click on it and see,F
um,F
they are,F
calci,F
channel blockers or calcium antagonist i like that,F
all right,F
treat a variety of conditions such as high blood pressure chest pain,F
an,F
renaults disease,F
but i,F
don't see anything about migraines let me just do a quick,R
sure,F
cheap,F
yeah there's nothing on this web page it has anything to do with migraines,F
uh it looks like it's just,F
um,F
blood pressure,F
okay,F
so i can go back to let me again,F
yeah cause maybe this one is just like that earlier question we had an accident doesn't have a right answer is wrong,F
possibly,F
um,F
uh there preventative medicines that are used to prevent migraine headaches so funny how yeah uh the mayo clinic says it's for high blood pressure and,F
mariko,F
webmd says it's for migraines,F
we will take that okay,F
um side effects,F
are,F
a slow heart rate swelling lower legs and ankles,F
constipation or diarrhea,F
thanks,F
either either way,F
dizziness or lightheadedness,F
flush or feeling warm,F
an,F
join the call your doctor if you have,R
the only difference here is swelling of your face lips tundra through,F
oh yeah that sounds can serious okay well a boy will really wish we didn't have migraine headaches that doesn't sound good,F
yeah,F
so now you in a natural,F
yes we want diet diet and exercise in my grades,F
um,F
alright so,F
do you want specifically diet and exercise are just natural,R
yeah i don't i don't want to hear about like hot rocks are christians or not,F
okay,F
alright so we have a few,F
okay,F
we have,F
pass line dot com,F
peace peace erm dot org,F
which is um,R
i don't know what that is,F
sounds like a non-profit um,F
seven tea again but that's just preventing it doesn't say anything about diana so it just says a diet but i don't know if it's going to,F
taking food that trigger migraines on webmd,F
yeah take a look at that,R
we look at that,F
okay,F
us all sorts of things,F
call cricket,R
starla see studies have proven only a few food or substances in food seemed to bring on a headache and a lot of people,F

recently you had dinner with your cows and she's very cynical and kept telling you that nobody ever helps others unless there's something in it for them,F
you'd love to prove her wrong so you want,F
find accounts selfless heroic acts by individuals or small groups that benefit others more for cox,R
oh,F
so,F
let's see so all true is all,R
tourism,F
so what we could just search for selfless heroic acts as comes up there,F
um,F
so,F
yeah so sharp her argument was that uh,F
people don't do,F
heroic deeds for nothing or,F
yep,F
yeah she's going to get the sum up the something in it for them there's always something in it for them so we're trying to find,F
evidence that people do do you know selfless heroic acts so,R
any like news clips or anything like that probably will be where we want to go so,R
okay um,F
yeah,F
so,F
so i would think a,F
so i just think,F
there is be a study on or something,F
well that's the general like a general search the internet should get us some news hits back in the search query,F
yeah problem is i agree with her,F
right,F
so let's see,R
that's fair,F
yeah,F
that's where,F
um,F
selfless aerobics let's see what comes up,R
yep,F
now according to the web search,F
but the only person who thought that,F
according to my hyperlinks that have already been clicked,F
oh dear,F
um let's say let me know i'm going to look for um,R
so,F
the reputable works website,F
today again,F
uh sorry usa today let's see um,R
i'd like to find,R
you know i'm gonna,F
see if there's a study out here we go,R
i'd like to find a um,R
dot eighty you or something,F
like a,F
educators website,R
so i can kind of trusted a little more,F
but i'm not saying i'm not i don't know how to i don't necessarily know how to them might have to use google,F
yeah,F
yeah i think i understood the general the general internet search will be enough right it's,F
because,F
you know in all honesty,F
she may disagree with whatever we find anyway set up,F
yeah um also i was thinking if um,F
if there's a a a name for it,F
i can look that up,F
i mean,F
we're looking for altruistic acts right so uh acts that people would do that but it's expresses expected get nothing back in return,F
i don't think i spelled it right but i didn't get a correction here,F
it will probably close enough,F
area,F
yeah,F
so here we go philosophy,F
is it,R
able to truly selfless or altruistic lee,F
um act,F
this is an um,F
philosophy website,R
and i don't think that's going to meet our requirements that we are looking for it does appear yeah like specific accounts that were looking for specific acts,F
just this,F
but is,R
is she arguing that it never happens or she arguing that,R
well,F
it's not truly selfless,F
well the task description for us is what we want to do is we let me go back so it says uh you'd love to prove wrong so you want to find accounts selfless rock acts by individual smokers were not looking to try to persuade her precise like this happen in this happened in this happen and this happened okay now you put ink so,F
okay,F
yeah i gotcha,F
yeah,F
we have,F
gotcha,F
um,F
all right let me go back to,R
the first one and you know ships,F
ten selfless acts of heroism on brain jet dot com,F
you know we we yes,F
and that will give us,F
i mean it looks like a click,F
insight so i'm not really digging it,F
well we could search some we could do some john your answer so natural events i mean we could look for her for like a rogue acts like nine eleven and we should get some,F
oh really,F
you know i am i'm going to click news,F
because at least that will give me news accounts,F
okay,F
kind of forgot about that um,F

this this summer during your vacation your plan to go on a touring trip of north america,F
you want information to help you plan your journey and there are many tourist attractions you would be interested in visiting,R
go set aside three months for the trip and hope to see as much of the continent as you can,R
as you cannot drive you will have to use public transport,F
but are unsure which type to take,F
task,R
it's our task bearing in mind this context your task is to decide on the best form transportation between cities in north america and what,F
that would,F
that would be suitable for you,F
so bury my we can't drive,F
we gotta figure out so the task to decide what's best for transportation so best way to get around cities,F
um,F
why is it a list of cities or anything like that,R
it doesn't seem to be uh the task seems to be is like,F
this is uh this is a question more directed i think towards me,F
because it's not we're not having an example to work from so this is if i take it from that context is basically says what do you want to visit,F
and basically in the three much at visit what's the best way to travel around all these different locations whatever those location sweep,F
okay,F
okay so worried,F
where you want to go,R
oh gosh so i gotta seize so the goal is to see as much the continent as you can,F
um,F
well since it doesn't sound like poor,F
i guess i would do a lot fly,F
a lot of flying,F
okay,F
oh,F
because even even like,F
even with you know,F
so for example like if i want to go see like mount rushmore,F
so how would i get from now from seattle to mount rushmore,R
if i was like,F
so i can i can fly somewhere out there close by but i don't know how to get from the city too,F
the site so,F
right because you don't have public transportation right i mean you have to take competition,F
right yes it can be yeah i don't have a car canceled site is publishers rotation,F
so that would automatically rule out i guess going about rushmore cause i don't know if there's a bus,F
well at all the way out there um,F
yeah,F
let's see,R
there's a a a website that popped up,F
called road trippers,F
okay,F
and let's see it's like you're very your vacation your road trip your weekend let's travel together,R
you can basically pick,F
i've never seen a cycle for some scratch broke through it and see,F
um you know a website i like i used to like to use before,F
google maps and mapquest and all that and i'll see if they still have one answer,R
rand mcnally,F
okay yeah,F
um they used to have a plan your trip type thing,F
i see,F
i need you would put in on it looks like they still have a,F
i still have a website,F
considering so,F
yeah i don't have and use a site along time so they have atlases so let's say let's say you're going to start in redmond washington,R
okay,F
and you want to go to my,F
rushmore see well let's just see what,R
it says you should do,F
rent a car,R
yeah,F
this,F
that's right no uh,F
well i know um,F
actually no one,F
i'll see if this has it but um,F
i know,F
that google maps you can pick your mode of transportation and if i pick bus it'll tell me,R
oh clever that's clever,F
how long it'll take to to take a buzz if you know if there's available i don't see that on,R
um rand mcnally site but allah give it a try,F
i'm not make sense though it's like it's going to be out some combination of,F
planes to get around quickly between like state the state and then,F
right,F
once you get to like the hot then you need some way of getting from the heart to the actual site so there will be apostles sometime right,F
so um,F
so let's see if it,R
if it has see i'm going to click on directions here,F
uh yeah and so now i have all these options in directions i got car,F
transit,F
walking biking an airplane,F
so,F
well let's see one we click the transit button and see how they would tell us to get from redmond to the alamo,R
yeah,F
let me put my starting point because it's not good,R
oh i guess i need to spell right,F
redmond washington,F
so if i click,F
psychic card takes eighteen hours in a minute if i click transit up now nothing,F
it could be out of bed there is a wide swath of america i will be unable to see,F
no,F
take it,R
well it will take you three hundred eighty eight hours to walk it,F
um,F
in four hours to fly so,F
so we must get close then,F
um well,F
that just gets here,F
i guess in san antonio,F
yeah i guess you get you catch get your clothes um but then let's see what the a,F
it shows you the dotted line for the second leg of the trip,F
but it doesn't tell you how you should,F
do that second leg of the trip,R
all right well i guess i guess and i'm i'm restricted to go see urban urban likes you know landmarks and things so i guess we'll be visiting dallas clothes,F
um,F
yeah,F
yeah,F
um so i would say um,F
if i were do if you are my boss and you said hey,G
i want to go to these places,F
um as long as they were,F
fairly urban,F
i'd get you the flights and then get here the bus schedules,F
based on um,F
so let's say if you want to go to somewhere in houston right,R
or i don't know what major city,F
well i guess we'll i guess expanding their i think in this public transportation thing i i could count tuber is like public transport right i could just pay some guy and and astronomical amount of money to drag me from the airport at the alamo and wait for me while i go two to nothing,F
all right,F
yeah,F
yeah um,F
fuck,F
but also like so if i picked um i don't know it's it's uh,F
yeah,F
alcatraz now that would make everybody,F
even hard are trying to think of a golden gate bridge right okay list,F
okay okay okay,F
yeah,F
because i think,F
let me type in the landmark and see okay so it gives me the flight,R
right and then let's see if the second leg,R
i'm clicking on different things here to see,F
transit,F
okay so transit if i click on transit,F
um,F
since you,F
that you can leave at eight oh nine on tuesday you'll get there at nine ten am on wednesday,F
then um,F
it's a seventeen minute walk from the train station,F
okay,F
so there's options where you can walk in it will tell you exactly,F
where you go and how you need to get there but flight are in this is all train right this is all train if i click on that the flight,R
right,F
uh it gives you the flight but it doesn't give you the,F
the second leg of the journey,F
but i bet if i put in san francisco international airport,F
to golden gate bridge,F
it would um,F
okay well yeah the task just describes for us down the best form of transportation between cities so whether that be planes trains are bus line i suppose so,F
can't complain,F
yeah i'm thing complain too,F
uh i have taken the bus from seattle down to san francisco that was a long bus ride,F
yeah i bet,F
okay that's uh,F
i'm satisfied my answers so i'm going to click the next one that was a lot of funds,F
alright alright,F
yeah,F

where is the are the venues of the two thousand twenty four olympic games,R
thank you,F
does it say anything about like what it who the host is which doesn't twenty for the games,R
well it says that there's five cities in the running,F
okay,F
went on to this article was in twenty fifty,F
they decide,F
oh it's is the winner is announced in,F
september twenty seventeen,F
okay,F

let me just thank what years,R
i know it wasn't the last one in like,F

it was in brazil,F
wait a second is that we do our own things,R
summer,F
winter,F
so the twenty eighteen winter olympics according to wicca pedia looks like,F
it's um in south korea,F
in john chaney,F
and that there was nothing in twenty sixteen,F
in the one before that was in twenty fourteen,F
twenty fourteen russia,F
okay um,F

maybe,F
neither really can be answered schahs they're asking for the venues for the twenty twenty four olympic games and that's still undecided,F
and then also asking for the venues which is sixteen major league games and that wasn't even think,F

a map uh winter olympics were into his fourteen in two thousand are in russia and then just eighteen south korea winter olympics did not occur in twenty sixteen that sound right with which is okay go let's context,F
yep,F

"
you had dinner with your cousin,F
she's very cynical kept telling you that nobody ever helps others unless there's something in it for them,F
you love to prove her wrong so you want to find accounts of selfless heroic acts by individuals or small groups for the benefit of others or for cos,F
so accounts of selfless heroic acts by individuals or small groups,F
well i have something that's altruism on-line from reddit stories,F
and then there's also,F
reliable maybe then there's also,F
another serious news,F
story,F
how many stories do we need,R
oh let's just like says uh,R
it doesn't have a number since you want to find accounts of stuff with stroke acts um,F
so what is the first and he said,R
the first one i think was a bunch,F
just like,F
things that happened in um,R
read it i'm guessing it's probably things that maybe we're started on read it in the people did ultra stick things to help someone,F
on line that they didn't know,F
and then,F
here's another,R
the traditional cbs saying that is,F
about an altruistic donor in the trance,F
transplant change she inspired,F
um,F
he inspired it saying,F
transplants,F
okay,F
like organ transplants i guess,F
so they inspired,F
yeah,F
uh so looks like,F
fifty five year old woman who donated her kidneys whatever kidneys to its stranger and then it set off a rare chain reaction donations,F
thanks,F
what did she die,R
a kidney,F
okay,F
fifteen hundred woman donate kidney to a stranger,F
um and then searched other people so do the same thing,F
yes i'm not really clear how this happened,F
thanks,F
oh and then one of the kidney transplant recipients created some software that help pair other people with matches for donating kidneys i guess,F
and then i look at the other link,F
thanks,F
any more examples,R
uh yes so let me see here,R
i got something on that first one so how bout are there any like um so mentions,R
um individuals or small groups for the benefit of others or for cause,F
um so there any like,R
group state like donate to or do some good like a,F
um,F
i can't think of the,F
like habitat for humanity or,F
i mean like make a wish or something like that,F
yeah yeah,F
what's your question,R
i guess i'm thinking like different accounts of stuff things like that like uh,F
what did you search when you found that first one,R
um all tourism,F
stories something like that,F
um,F
i mean these stories from red it there's a guy who had terminal cancer where he was going to die in within a year in everybody offered him to stay at their homes and donated,F
non,F
airline miles so that he could travel around the world,F
and another one,F
thanks,F
another one with square looks like this guy was in,F
says he,F
felt like he filled his children because he was badly in debt and couldn't afford to buy the christmas presents,F
um,F
and then he broke,F
it's laying to take time off work in that it ended up that everybody,F
and it up,F
paying for his different utility bills,F
um anonymously and,F
and then the community credit check,F
well um,F
ended up,F
donating ten thousand dollars to help his family get on his feet,F
thank you,F
thanks,F
okay nice,F
so we have three pretty good stories let me just let me just redo this mixture,R
okay,F
uh,F
recently i dinner with your cousin she's very cynical and kept telling you that nobody ever helps others unless there's something in it for them,F
you don't approve of wrongs you want to find accounts of selfless acts by individuals or small groups for the benefit of others were for cops,F
so it looks like all of these are kind of fit that bill,F
yeah,F
okay i like it,F
okay,F
it's working,F
i wait for the first one he said was from cvs test the fifty five year old woman right,F
and the other two were they for an read it over,R
um they were on huffington post but it was a compilation of uplifting stories from read it,F
okay,F
if the cousin a cynical i think she's going to ask for sources,F

right this summer during your vacation you're planning to go on a touring trip of north america,F
you want information to help you plan your journey and there are many turret tourist attractions you'd be interested in visiting,R
you have set aside three months for the trip and hope to see as much of the continent as you can,F
as you cannot drive you have to use public transport,F
but are unsure which type to take,F
task bearing in mind this context your task is to decide on the best form of transportation between cities in north america that would be suitable for civil for you,F
so let's see here,R
so,F
what is what is my trip again i'm just going all over north america,R
all over north america for three months and you want to see as much of the content as you can,F
but you can't drive,F
um,F
you have to take public transport,F
thanks,F
what are you searching if you don't mind me asking,R
um,F
no first sided how to tour north america without a car and then i did how to tour north american public transportation,F
okay,F
doesn't this sounds pretty broad,R
i feel like it depends on what you want to see north north america obviously is huge so,F
right,F
well i guess i'm thinking also like are we going to mexico i mean it's kind of different if you're not just in the us,F
totally yeah,F
also nobody's,F
deleted like,F
cash at history in this browser so things are already clicked on,R
it's kinda distracted,F
so what are they really wanted,R
so i guess all they want us to do is to decide the best form of transportation between cities in north america,F
just,F
between cities,F
um,F
yes i mean it's,F
and then you want to see as much as possible in three months,F
so it,F
i don't know what to search as far as like the search goes but,F
um,F
obviously like a bus not gonna be the solution,F
yeah i don't know i mean it kinda depends on if you just want to go to major cities you know i'm sure the train probably ghost all major cities but if you wanted smaller cities and then it would be more,F
buses,F
yeah um,F
i guess like,F
yeah said uh i mean it's a little bit weird now bear in mind this context your task is to decide the best form of transportation between cities in north america that would be suitable for you so um,F
and also that did they say that you can see the most of the united states or something,R
yeah it says set aside three months for the trip and hope to see as much of the continent as you can,F
had the most of us,F
so i guess let's think about it like it's like we were going,R
to do this trip ourselves like,F
what would you want to see and,R
what would be the best,R
means that ranch public transportation,F
to see those things,F
i don't know i guess i would,F
sync more along the lines of what's a comfortable mode of transportation,R
and it also depends on how much it really costs,F
because you know like i think it's nice to take a train,F
but it's also really not that economical,F
compared to bus but you could probably get something more comfortable than a bus,F
so,F
i don't know but then i think buses probably go to more places than trains do,F
that's that's true yeah,F
so i would probably is,F
some mixture but i'm not really telling you that out of any research that i'm doing right now,F
so we have to choose just one,F
uh i guess so um so let's just i mean if we want to see,R
the statue of liberty and not rushmore,F
and disneyland,F
um,F
what would be the best method i guess,R
i mean maybe you could even do like uh,F
trains from california's too,F
new york or something like that,F
i mean i don't know what would possibly come up but,F
thanks,F
and is if the information getting like seems feasible like oh yes here's a ticket right here and i guess that would be it but it may be,R
it seems,F
uh really longer it there's not really like connecting,F
well like mount rushmore for example you can't even take any public transportation there,F
it basically says that you would have,F
to get a private tour company,F
to take you,F
or rent a car,R
interesting,F
yeah,F
i guess we're not going to my restaurant,F
but if you want like,F
los angeles to new york,F
yeah or new york to dessi,F
thank you,F
but that could probably be a treat,F
yeah,F
i mean unless there's like stops on the way like i don't even know that you could just get,F
a train from,F
i was not direct anyway like from like all the way across the country from dessi too,F
la,F
so maybe other there are like,F
maybe,F
trains that would be like good options i don't know that it would be enough for everything so,F
do you mean you don't think that it's the same route,R
yeah,F
so like,F
i mean obviously there are trains that run all over but i don't know that,F
there's little like like a plane fly from here to any major city really most major cities um,F
trains michael bit more spread out and not like a complete,F
inclusive option,F
maybe even try like,R
bus,F
trip from,F
dessi too,F
la or something like that,F
and then it's like,F
it seems more reasonable than they would actually have a trip,F
have a bus that would,F
make that trip,R
eventually anyway,F
yeah i don't know i mean i know that i've tried to book amtrak chips before in their website it kinda sucks,F
so it's confusing to try and like figure out if there is a direct route,F
yeah,F
i'm sure a bus would stop here and there,F
yeah i mean,F
thanks,F
thanks,F
i mean i think that,F
this is the kind of thing i'd probably take a few hours on,F
yeah definitely yeah,F
um i mean i guess we can put,F
bus for now i guess my thought is that the bus a bus would be,F
you can pretty much get a bus to go anywhere any like major city and with trains it's like,F
not quite,F
you can get him to go to like close places i guess but not,F
not quite like a bus,F
right,F
so i guess we got the bus that's that's a good trick into research,F
yeah i mean i think you would find more places to go to with the bus,F
yeah and if you want to see as much as possible and you have three months it's not like you're in like a super hurry so,F
and you,F
yeah,F
thanks,F
okay,F
we're going to bus,F
okay,F
okay now,F

yeah,F
if they haven't had vaccine yet,F

the range of nine to twenty six year old girls that sent out right,F
i didn't see ten on there but i'm assuming that like,F
